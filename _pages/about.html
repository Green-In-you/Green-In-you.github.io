            <p>Our vision is to facilitate sustainable consumerism in urban India.</p>
            <h3 class="title" style="padding-top: 2em;">Mission</h3>
            <p>We aim to create a community which enables socializing, networking, learning, developing professionally and most
                importantly, empowering individuals to lead sustainable lifestyles. As we work towards our primary mission, we also
                seek to bridge inter- and intra-generational financial, material and intellectual resource gaps within our community.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Through setting up Green In You, we were able to encourage people from a strata of the society who never in their lives
                        had shopped secondhand. They now enthusiastically come out to normalize reusing clothes. We built a respectable
                        environment which destigmatized secondhand shopping and sowed a seed for fighting against the second largest
                        polluter in the world, fashion!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Our circular model extends the lifespan of thousands of products per sale, keeping resources within the economy and
                        hence diverting them from landfills. GIY works to reduce the demand for virgin material resources and their consequent
                        extractive impacts.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>We understand that as the ravaging effects of climate change are becoming more distinct, their brunt is unjustly borne
                        by the poor. We see it as our responsibility to funnel economic, intellectual and material resources towards the lower
                        socio-economic classes in order to build their capacity to prosper.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The youth coming together to set up our events are involved in exploring their creative energies, collaborating
                        effectively and developing their professional acumen. At Green In You, we believe that to solve problems bigger than
                        ourselves it is essential to actively engage within the local community and cultivate a sense of purpose amongst us.
                        Strengthening our social capital equips us to make our world a better place.</p>
