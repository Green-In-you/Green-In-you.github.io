                <p style="font-size: 16px;">To facilitate sustainable consumerism in urban India</p>
                <h3 class="section-heading-letterspaced">Mission</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">We aim to create a community which enables socializing, networking, learning, developing professionally and most
                importantly, empowering individuals to lead sustainable lifestyles. As we work towards our primary mission, we also seek
                to bridge inter- and intra-generational financial, material and intellectual resource gaps within our community.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">However, today, people’s shopping habits have extensively changed because of
                stimulus from
                the fashion giants. Since companies churn out brand new styles about 52 times a year people feel
                “out-of-fashion”
                quickly and desire new clothing. Therefore, unlike previous times, clothing gets discarded not because it is
                ragged, but
                simply because people are bored of it.”</p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">If these barely used clothes are still in prime condition, they really should not be
                    thrown away and swamp the planet, causing catastrophic environment damage. Instead, we should work to get
                    rid of
                    the stigma present and normalise reusing clothes. Sustainable fashion is not just for the low socio-economic
                    class; it
                    is for every conscious individual who wants to appreciate and enjoy fashion in harmony with nature!”</p>

                <h2 class="green-h3" style="color: black; padding-bottom: 1em;"> OUR IMPACTS</h2>
                <p>Through setting up Green In You, we were able to encourage people from a strata of the society who never in their lives
                had shopped secondhand. They now enthusiastically come out to normalize reusing clothes. We built a respectable
                environment which destigmatized secondhand shopping and sowed a seed for fighting against the second largest polluter in
                the world, fashion!</p>
                <p>Our circular model extends the lifespan of thousands of products per sale, keeping resources within the economy and
                hence diverting them from landfills. GIY works to reduce the demand for virgin material resources and their consequent
                extractive impacts.</p>
                <p>We understand that as the ravaging effects of climate change are becoming more distinct, their brunt is unjustly borne
                by the poor. We see it as our responsibility to funnel economic, intellectual and material resources towards the lower
                socio-economic classes in order to build their capacity to prosper.</p>
                <p>The youth coming together to set up our events are involved in exploring their creative energies, collaborating
                effectively and developing their professional acumen. At Green In You, we believe that to solve problems bigger than
                ourselves it is essential to actively engage within the local community and cultivate a sense of purpose amongst us.
                Strengthening our social capital helps us to make our world a better place.</p>
