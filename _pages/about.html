            <h3 class="section-heading-letterspaced" style="font-size: 30px; padding-bottom: 1em;">TANISHA GHORPADE</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;"> We want to eradicate the stigma associated with reusing clothes. Sustainable fashion is
                for anyone who wants to
                appreciate and enjoy fashion in harmony with nature. By creating a respectable circular system, we aim to
                magnify the
                social and environmental benefits of pre-owned fashion. </p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">“I’ve observed second-hand clothing is still visualized as ragged, dirty clothing.
                This image may have been true in the past when apparel was purchased by the customer and then
                disposed after rigorous use.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">However, today, people’s shopping habits have extensively changed because of
            stimulus from
            the fashion giants. Since companies churn out brand new styles about 52 times a year people feel
            “out-of-fashion”
            quickly and desire new clothing. Therefore, unlike previous times, clothing gets discarded not because it is
            ragged, but
            simply because people are bored of it.”</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">If these barely used clothes are still in prime condition, they really should not be
                thrown away and swamp the planet, causing catastrophic environment damage. Instead, we should work to get
                rid of
                the stigma present and normalise reusing clothes. Sustainable fashion is not just for the low socio-economic
                class; it
                is for every conscious individual who wants to appreciate and enjoy fashion in harmony with nature!”</p>

            <p>Through setting up ‘Green in You’, we were able to encourage people from a strata of the society; who never in their
            lives had shopped second-hand.They now enthusiastically came out to normalize reusing clothes.</p>
            <p>We built a respectable
            environment which destigmatized second-hand shopping and sowed a seed for fighting against the second largest polluter
            in the world, fashion!</p>
            <p>Besides promoting sustainable fashion, upcycling and extending the lifespan of over a thousand
            clothing items, we diverted all our profits towards organizations working dedicatedly for women empowerment,
            sustainability, animal and human welfare.</p>
