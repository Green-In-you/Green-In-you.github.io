It was 1907, and synthetic plastic was invented. However, it was only later until the
1930s during the industrial era that plastic was commercially, widely available. I think
when it comes to plastic, there are a multitude of seemingly impossible possibilities. The
first of course was its transformative invention. A substance like never before-
chemically inert, water-resistant, insulates well, doesn’t break easily and is cheap to
produce. No doubt, these characteristics were quick to kickstart man’s love affair with
plastic.


Within only one human lifetime, before we knew it, plastic was virtually everywhere. No,
not only in every household on the planet but literally everywhere we have ever looked.
According to Dickinson the author of Planet Plastic, plastic today is in the Arctic and the
Antarctic, and also in the middle of the Pacific. It is in our drinking water, the ocean’s
greatest depths, the soil, the air we breathe and even in entire food chains. Every human
being today ingests about 2000 particles of microplastic each week of their lives. This
quantity is comparative to eating a whole credit card on a weekly basis. What’s more, is
that greater than half the plastic that was ever created came into being only since 2002!
Who would have even thought plastic would take over our world so drastically, such that
the World Economic Forum warned it’s likely there will be more plastic in our oceans
than actual fish by weight in the year 2050?


I care deeply about the well-being of the planet and all its habitants. The plastic pollution
problem today threatens not only my ability to live in a healthy, stable environment but
that of every generation to come because of the forever substance that plastic has been
built to be. Besides, it’s utterly unnerving how the lack of research about the
toxicological effects of plastic is the only factor keeping us from unveiling a host of
adverse health impacts within that pandora’s box!


Now, I staunchly advocate for what Theodore Roosevelt said, “Natural resources are
assets which must be turned over to the next generation increased and not impaired in
value”. However, solving the magnanimous plastic problem before irreversible negative
impacts take place, seems nearly impossible to me. But I will still then, nurture
confidence in myself and every other conscious individual who dares to care. Because, I
know, that every now and then the seemingly impossible becomes possible through just a
flash of discovery, revealing new potentials and revolutions like never before!
