                    <p>I’ve observed second-hand clothing is still visualized as ragged, dirty clothing. This image may have been true in the past when apparel was purchased by the customer and then disposed after rigorous use.</p>

<p>However, today, people’s shopping habits have extensively changed because of stimuli from the fashion giants. The fashion industry nurtures consumerism. They introduced fast-fashion where brands like H&amp;M, Forever21 and Zara among others have as many as 52 seasons in a year. This is far off from the initial three seasons brands had, in which styles would change as per the summer, winter and monsoon.</p>

<p>Since companies churn out brand new styles about 52 times a year people feel “out-of-fashion” quickly and desire new clothing. This trend has been going on long enough for it to have become a habit, and now the customer is looking forward to changes much sooner. Therefore, unlike previous times, clothing gets discarded not because it is ragged, but simply because people are bored of it, it’s out of style, or a ton of new clothing has left no space in the closet for the not-so-old clothes.</p>

<p>If these barely used clothes are still in their prime condition, they really should not be thrown away, causing catastrophic environmental damage. Instead, we should work to get rid of the stigma present and normalise reusing clothes. Sustainable fashion is not just for the low socio-economic class; it is for every conscious individual who
wants to appreciate and enjoy fashion in harmony with nature!</p>

<p>Times have changed, so should we.</p>

                        <p>I hadn’t a clue who I was. And, like many others, I’ve always felt a desperation to know and be more of myself. When the world came to a staggering halt this year, I witnessed some clarity. The pandemic had me live alone in a five bedroom apartment – no roommates, let alone very many people to spare in our student town. So every morning I’d head to a trail nearby. Within the stream which ran parallel to it, there were three rocks. The third rock, also the biggest, also right in the middle of the stream, was my literal sweet spot. There I sat for an hour everyday in the midst of nature. On the canopy of trees overhead, several times I’d spot the most gorgeous birds. So many intriguing insects everywhere and sometimes, they’d even crawl up onto me, chase me – yes, I got chased by a big, fat bumble bee! There were days when I got lucky, and deer, foxes, groundhogs, would sneak up on me. The stream’s babbling was tranquilizing. I felt one with everything around me, I felt utterly included. For the first time in my life, I experienced the presence of a safe space to be myself, because every being around me too – the trees, the birds, the animals, the insects – were also just being their true selves. They were awake and alert, they seemed truly alive.</p>

                        <p>It was 1907, and synthetic plastic was invented. However, it was only later until the
1930s during the industrial era that plastic was commercially, widely available. I think
when it comes to plastic, there are a multitude of seemingly impossible possibilities. The
first of course was its transformative invention. A substance like never before-
chemically inert, water-resistant, insulates well, doesn’t break easily and is cheap to
produce. No doubt, these characteristics were quick to kickstart man’s love affair with
plastic.</p>
