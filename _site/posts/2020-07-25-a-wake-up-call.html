                    <p>I hadn’t a clue who I was. And, like many others, I’ve always felt a desperation to know and be more of myself. When the world came to a staggering halt this year, I witnessed some clarity. The pandemic had me live alone in a five bedroom apartment – no roommates, let alone very many people to spare in our student town. So every morning I’d head to a trail nearby.</p>

<p>Within the stream which ran parallel to it, there were three rocks. The third rock, also the biggest, also right in the middle of the stream, was my literal sweet spot. There I sat for an hour everyday in the midst of nature. On the canopy of trees overhead, several times I’d spot the most gorgeous birds. So many intriguing insects everywhere and sometimes, they’d even crawl up onto me, chase me – yes, I got chased by a big, fat bumble bee! There were days when I got lucky, and deer, foxes, groundhogs, would sneak up on me. The stream’s babbling was tranquilizing. I felt one with everything around me, I felt utterly included. For the first time in my life, I experienced the presence of a safe space to be myself, because every being around me too – the trees, the birds, the animals, the insects – were also just being their true selves. They were awake and alert, they seemed truly alive.</p>

<p>You see, I had a lot of time to let loose and express myself authentically. Nature gave me that space free from the shackles of our made-up world. In the human world, I had been trying harder than ever to emulate anyone society upheld, I felt a fake. What this time has brought is a whole new paradigm. I cannot exaggerate harder how us humans are more a part of nature than we are above it or apart from it. I’m writing to you, because I want to tell you that you too have the capacity to transcend the insecurities of yourself, and proudly embody your reality, your being, just like nature naturally does.</p>

<p>It’s my affirmation that our path to deep satisfaction and a life thoroughly, happily lived lies closer to wilderness than our human social and economic bubbles. Which is why here I am, trying to sound the alarm – nature as we’ve known since the beginning of humankind’s journey is dying. Blatant disregard for nature’s plight leads nowhere, but the perish of our own sanity and of course, the perpetuity of our existence. This message is also a call to action. Through Green In You, I’ve been able to realign my lifestyle. As much satisfaction I feel relieving nature from the pervasiveness of the sheer abundance of my clothing, I feel pride. Every day our team is working very hard to bring you and your loved ones the same chance to make a difference. There’s a lot that can be done and we want to help you start with your closet.</p>

                    <p>I’ve observed second-hand clothing is still visualized as ragged, dirty clothing. This image may have been true in the past when apparel was purchased by the customer and then disposed after rigorous use. However, today, people’s shopping habits have extensively changed because of stimuli from the fashion giants. The fashion industry nurtures consumerism. They introduced fast-fashion where brands like H&amp;M, Forever21 and Zara among others have as many as 52 seasons in a year. This is far off from the initial three seasons brands had, in which styles would change as per the summer, winter and monsoon.</p>

                    <p>It was 1907, and synthetic plastic was invented. However, it was only later until the
1930s during the industrial era that plastic was commercially, widely available. I think
when it comes to plastic, there are a multitude of seemingly impossible possibilities. The
first of course was its transformative invention. A substance like never before-
chemically inert, water-resistant, insulates well, doesn’t break easily and is cheap to
produce. No doubt, these characteristics were quick to kickstart man’s love affair with
plastic.</p>
