            <p style="font-size:15px; font-weight:300; color:#4B4B4B;">We want to eradicate the stigma associated with reusing clothes. Sustainable fashion is for anyone who wants to
            appreciate and enjoy fashion in harmony with nature. By creating a respectable circular system, we aim to magnify the
            social and environmental benefits of pre-owned fashion.
            <p style="font-size:15px; font-weight:300; color:#4B4B4B;">“I’ve observed second-hand clothing is still visualized as ragged, dirty clothing. This image may have been true in the past when apparel was purchased by the customer and then
            disposed after rigorous use. However, today, people’s shopping habits have extensively changed because of stimulus from
            the fashion giants. Since companies churn out brand new styles about 52 times a year people feel “out-of-fashion”
            quickly and desire new clothing. Therefore, unlike previous times, clothing gets discarded not because it is ragged, but
            simply because people are bored of it.”</p>
            <p style="font-size:15px; font-weight:300; color:#4B4B4B;">If these barely used clothes are still in prime condition, they really should not be thrown away and swamp the planet, causing catastrophic environment damage. Instead, we should work to get rid of
            the stigma present and normalise reusing clothes. Sustainable fashion is not just for the low socio-economic class; it
            is for every conscious individual who wants to appreciate and enjoy fashion in harmony with nature!”</p>
